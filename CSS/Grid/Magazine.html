            <p class="hero-subtitle">Security is the practice of protecting your intellectual property from
                unauthorized access, use, or modification. The triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability,
                or CIA, was originally developed to highlight the important aspects of information security
                within an organization.</p>

        <p class="first-paragraph">Security in the cloud is similar to security in on-premises data centers,
            only without the costs and complexities of protecting facilities and hardware.
            Because the cloud doesn't have any physical servers or storage devices, you use software-based security
            tools to monitor and protect the flow of information into and out of your AWS resources.

            At AWS, we strive to make security as familiar as what you are doing today. You can bring the same security
            models that you use today in your environment over to the cloud. This includes providing visibility,
            auditability, and controllability to your resources in the cloud. Additionally, AWS offers several services
            and tools to equip you with the agility and automation that you need to adapt to cloud-level scaling to take
            security to the next level.</p>
        <p>AWS provides methods and tools to manage access control for users, groups, and roles; provide temporary
            security credentials; and control encryption keys.

            The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service helps you securely control access to AWS resources for
            your users. Use IAM to control who can use your AWS resources (authentication), what resources they can use,
            and in what ways (authorization). You can define granular permissions for entities such as users, groups, or
            roles. This enables entities to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share
            your password or access key.</p>
        <p>You can grant different permissions to different people for different resources. For example, you might allow
            some users complete access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service
            (Amazon S3), and other AWS services. For other users, you can allow read-only access to just some S3
            buckets, permission to administer just some EC2 instances, or access to your billing information but nothing
            else. With IAM, you can also allow users who already have passwords elsewhere to access your AWS account.
            For example, users with passwords in your corporate network or with an internet identity provider can get
            access to your AWS account.</p>
        <blockquote><hr>
        <p class="quote">With AWS CloudHSM, you can protect your encryption keys within hardware security modules (HSMs)
            that are designed and validated to government standards for secure key management. You can securely
            generate, store, and manage the cryptographic keys used for data encryption in a way that ensures that only
            you have access to the keys. CloudHSM helps you comply with strict key management requirements within the
            AWS Cloud without sacrificing application performance</p>
        <hr>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's important to test and validate your protection measures to ensure that they meet compliance requirements
            and are operating as intended. Organizations typically rely on regular audits, either internal or external,
            of their environments to ensure conformity with policies and regulations.

            AWS services such as AWS CloudTrail can help you answer questions such as what actions did a specific user
            take over a given time period? For a specific resource, which user has taken actions on it over a given time
            period? What is the source IP address of a specific activity?</p>
        <p>The first step to secure your assets is to know what they are. You shouldn't need to guess what your IT
            inventory consists of, who is accessing your resources, and what actions anyone has run on your resources.

            AWS offers tools to keep track of and monitor your AWS resources, so you have instant visibility into your
            inventory, and your user and application activity. For example, by using AWS Config, you can discover
            existing AWS resources, export a complete inventory of your AWS resources with all configuration details,
            and determine how a resource was configured at any point in time. These capabilities can help you with
            compliance auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting</p>
        <p>AWS tools are purpose built, and tailored to your unique environment, size, and global requirements. By
            building security tools from the ground up, AWS can automate many of the routine tasks that security experts
            normally spend time on. This means AWS security experts can spend more timefocusing on measures to increase
            the security of your AWS Cloud environment. Customers can also automate security engineering and operations
            functions by using a comprehensive set of APIs and tools.

            When you automate by using AWS services such as AWS CloudFormation, rather than manually deploying an
            environment for forensics troubleshooting, for example, you can have AWS deploy an environment in a secure
            and reproducible manner.</p>

        <article class="brief-principles">
            <h3 class="list-title">Security Design Principles</h3>
            <p>the seven design principles from the security pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.</p>
            <ul class="lists">
                <li><h4 class="list-subtitle">Apply the principle of least privilege</h4>
                <p>An organizational security culture should be built on the principle of least privilege. Only grant
                    access to data and other resources to the people who really need that access. You can start with
                    denying access to everything and grant access as needed, based on job role.

                    A security best practice is to enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each
                    interaction with your AWS resources. Set expectations for how authority will be delegated down
                    through software engineers, operations staff, and other job functions that are involved in cloud
                    adoption.

                    By reducing or even ending reliance on long-term credentials, you can diminish your attack surface
                    area. You can use temporary credentials and require identities to dynamically acquire them. For
                    workforce identities, use AWS Single Sign-On or federation with IAM to access AWS accounts. For
                    machine identities, such as EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions, require the use of IAM roles,
                    instead of IAM users with long-term access keys</p></li>
                <li><h4 class="list-subtitle">Enable traceability</h4>
                <p>With AWS, you can monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time.
                    AWS provides native logging as well as services that you can use to provide greater visibility in
                    near-real time for occurrences in your environment. Integrate these tools with your existing logging
                    and monitoring solutions. Know what workloads are deployed and operational, so that you can audit
                    and ensure that the environment is operating at expected security governance levels and meeting
                    required security standards.

                    In AWS, you can implement detective controls by processing logs and events, and monitoring, which
                    allows for auditing, automated analysis, and alarming. CloudTraillogs, AWS API calls, and Amazon
                    CloudWatchprovide monitoring of metrics with alarming, and AWS Configprovides configuration history.
                    Amazon GuardDutyis a managed threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious or
                    unauthorized behavior to help you protect your AWS accounts and workloads. Service-level logs are
                    also available; for example, you can use Amazon S3 to log access requests.</p></li>
                <li><h4 class="list-subtitle">Secure all layers</h4>
                <p>Rather than only focusing on the protection of a single outer layer, apply a defense in depth
                    approach with other security controls. This means to apply security to all layers, such as your
                    network, application, and data store. For example, you can require users to strongly authenticate to
                    an application. In addition, ensure that users come from a trusted network path and require access
                    to the decryption keys to process encrypted data. One of the benefits of using AWS is that our
                    services are also built for integration. You can use several AWS services together to provide the
                    most secure environment for your data and resources.

                    AWS customers are able to tailor, or harden, the configuration of an EC2 instance, Amazon
                    ElasticContainer Service (Amazon ECS) container, or AWS Elastic Beanstalkinstance, and persist this
                    configuration to an immutable Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Then, all new virtual servers (instances)
                    launched with this AMI receive the hardened configuration, whether they are launched manually or
                    through automatic scaling.</p></li>
                <li><h4 class="list-subtitle">Automate security</h4>
                <p>AWS develops purpose-built security tools that can help you to automate many of the routine tasks
                    that security experts normally spend time on. This means the security experts can spend more time
                    focusing on measures to increase the security of your AWS Cloud environment.

                    You can automate security engineering and operations functions by using a comprehensive set of APIs
                    and tools. You can fully automate identity management, network security and data protection, and
                    monitoring capabilities, and deliver them by using popular software development methods that you
                    already have in place. Rather than having people monitor your security position and react to an
                    event, with automation, your system can monitor, review, and initiate a response.</p></li>
                <li><h4 class="list-subtitle">Protect data in transit and data at rest</h4>
                <p>Safeguarding data is a critical piece of building and operating information systems. AWS provides
                    services and features that help you to protect your data at rest and in transit. Safeguards include
                    fine-grained access controls to objects, creating and controlling the encryption keys that are used
                    to encrypt your data, selecting appropriate encryption methods, integrity validation, and
                    appropriate data retention. To help you manage protection, implement a tagging schema to classify
                    your data into sensitivity levels. Another security best practice is to construct mechanisms to
                    protect data in transit, such as using virtual private network (VPN) and Transport Layer Security
                    (TLS) connections.

                    AWS provides multiple means to encrypt data at rest and data in transit. We build features into our
                    services that make it easier to encrypt your data. For example, we have implemented server-side
                    encryption (SSE) for Amazon S3to make it easier for you to store your data in an encrypted form.
                    You can also arrange for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to handle the entire HTTPS encryption and
                    decryption process (generally known as SSL termination).</p></li>
                <li><h4 class="list-subtitle">Prepare for security events</h4>
                <p>Even with mature preventive and detective controls, you should put processes in place to respond to
                    and mitigate the potential impact of security incidents. The architecture of your workload strongly
                    affects your ability to operate effectively during an incident, isolate or contain systems, and
                    restore operations to a known good state. Put tools and access in place ahead of a security
                    incident. Then, routinely practice incident response through game days. This will help you ensure
                    that your architecture can accommodate timely investigation and recovery.</p></li>
                <li><h4 class="list-subtitle">Minimize the attack surface</h4>
                <p>Generally, a cyberattack shuts down due to two reasons: either the attackers exhaust themselves and
                    give up, or the attackers achieve their goal. Reduce your exposure to unintended access by hardening
                    operating systems and minimizing the components, libraries, and externally consumable services in
                    use. Start by reducing unused components, such as operating system packages and applications.
                    Configure security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
                    (Amazon VPC) to help reduce the attack surface of your applications.</p></li>

            <p class="quote">One approach to implement security and governance is to create a centralized team that is
                responsible for establishing repeatable processes and templates to deploy applications to AWS while
                maintaining organizational control over the deployments. Such a team could be either internal or
                external (third-party vendors), and is often referred to as a provisioning team, center of excellence,
                or managed services organization (MSO). External vendors are commonly referred to as managed service
                providers (MSPs). AWS validates AWS Partners under the AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Program.</p>
