        <p>Before you can configure a switch, you need to turn it on and allow it to go through the five-step boot
            sequence. This topic covers the basics of configuring a switch and includes a lab at the end.</p>
        <p>After a Cisco switch is powered on, it goes through the following five-step boot sequence:</p>
        <p>Step 1: First, the switch loads a power-on self-test (POST) program stored in ROM. POST checks the CPU
            subsystem. It tests the CPU, DRAM, and the portion of the flash device that makes up the flash file
            system.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Next, the switch loads the boot loader software. The boot loader is a small program stored in ROM
            that is run immediately after POST successfully completes.</p>
        <p>Step 3: The boot loader performs low-level CPU initialization. It initializes the CPU registers, which
            control where physical memory is mapped, the quantity of memory, and its speed.</p>
        <p>Step 4: The boot loader initializes the flash file system on the system board.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Finally, the boot loader locates and loads a default IOS operating system software image into memory
            and gives control of the switch over to the IOS.</p>
