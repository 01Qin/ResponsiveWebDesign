                them. </p>
            <p class="post-title">Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling
                Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost
                the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring,
                tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked
                by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduinâ€”alone, that is, save for the
                mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.</p>
