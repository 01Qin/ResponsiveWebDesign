        <p class="first-paragraph">Security in the cloud is similar to security in on-premises data centers,
            only without the costs and complexities of protecting facilities and hardware.
            Because the cloud doesn't have any physical servers or storage devices, you use software-based security
            tools to monitor and protect the flow of information into and out of your AWS resources.

            At AWS, we strive to make security as familiar as what you are doing today. You can bring the same security
            models that you use today in your environment over to the cloud. This includes providing visibility,
            auditability, and controllability to your resources in the cloud. Additionally, AWS offers several services
            and tools to equip you with the agility and automation that you need to adapt to cloud-level scaling to take
            security to the next level.</p>
        <p>AWS provides methods and tools to manage access control for users, groups, and roles; provide temporary
            security credentials; and control encryption keys.

            The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service helps you securely control access to AWS resources for
            your users. Use IAM to control who can use your AWS resources (authentication), what resources they can use,
            and in what ways (authorization). You can define granular permissions for entities such as users, groups, or
            roles. This enables entities to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share
            your password or access key.</p>
        <p>You can grant different permissions to different people for different resources. For example, you might allow
            some users complete access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service
            (Amazon S3), and other AWS services. For other users, you can allow read-only access to just some S3
            buckets, permission to administer just some EC2 instances, or access to your billing information but nothing
            else. With IAM, you can also allow users who already have passwords elsewhere to access your AWS account.
            For example, users with passwords in your corporate network or with an internet identity provider can get
            access to your AWS account.</p>
