            <p class="logo-subtitle">Security is the practice of protecting your intellectual property from
                unauthorized access, use, or modification. The triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability,
                or CIA, was originally developed to highlight the important aspects of information security

        <p class="first-paragraph">Security in the cloud is similar to security in on-premises data centers,
            only without the costs and complexities of protecting facilities and hardware.
            Because the cloud doesn't have any physical servers or storage devices, you use software-based security
            tools to monitor and protect the flow of information into and out of your AWS resources.

            At AWS, we strive to make security as familiar as what you are doing today. You can bring the same security
            models that you use today in your environment over to the cloud. This includes providing visibility,
            auditability, and controllability to your resources in the cloud. Additionally, AWS offers several services
            and tools to equip you with the agility and automation that you need to adapt to cloud-level scaling to take
            security to the next level.</p>
        <p>AWS provides methods and tools to manage access control for users, groups, and roles; provide temporary
            security credentials; and control encryption keys.

            The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service helps you securely control access to AWS resources for
            your users. Use IAM to control who can use your AWS resources (authentication), what resources they can use,
            and in what ways (authorization). You can define granular permissions for entities such as users, groups, or
            roles. This enables entities to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share
            your password or access key.</p>
        <p>You can grant different permissions to different people for different resources. For example, you might allow
            some users complete access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service
            (Amazon S3), and other AWS services. For other users, you can allow read-only access to just some S3
            buckets, permission to administer just some EC2 instances, or access to your billing information but nothing
            else. With IAM, you can also allow users who already have passwords elsewhere to access your AWS account.
            For example, users with passwords in your corporate network or with an internet identity provider can get
            access to your AWS account.</p>
        <blockquote><hr>
        <p class="quote">With AWS CloudHSM, you can protect your encryption keys within hardware security modules (HSMs)
            that are designed and validated to government standards for secure key management. You can securely
            generate, store, and manage the cryptographic keys used for data encryption in a way that ensures that only
            you have access to the keys. CloudHSM helps you comply with strict key management requirements within the
            AWS Cloud without sacrificing application performance</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>It's important to test and validate your protection measures to ensure that they meet compliance requirements
            and are operating as intended. Organizations typically rely on regular audits, either internal or external,
            of their environments to ensure conformity with policies and regulations.

            AWS services such as AWS CloudTrail can help you answer questions such as what actions did a specific user
            take over a given time period? For a specific resource, which user has taken actions on it over a given time
            period? What is the source IP address of a specific activity?</p>
        <p>The first step to secure your assets is to know what they are. You shouldn't need to guess what your IT
            inventory consists of, who is accessing your resources, and what actions anyone has run on your resources.

            AWS offers tools to keep track of and monitor your AWS resources, so you have instant visibility into your
            inventory, and your user and application activity. For example, by using AWS Config, you can discover
            existing AWS resources, export a complete inventory of your AWS resources with all configuration details,
            and determine how a resource was configured at any point in time. These capabilities can help you with
            compliance auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting</p>
        <p>AWS tools are purpose built, and tailored to your unique environment, size, and global requirements. By
            building security tools from the ground up, AWS can automate many of the routine tasks that security experts
            normally spend time on. This means AWS security experts can spend more timefocusing on measures to increase
            the security of your AWS Cloud environment. Customers can also automate security engineering and operations
            functions by using a comprehensive set of APIs and tools.

            When you automate by using AWS services such as AWS CloudFormation, rather than manually deploying an
            environment for forensics troubleshooting, for example, you can have AWS deploy an environment in a secure
            and reproducible manner.</p>
